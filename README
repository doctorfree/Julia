Calculate and graphically display Julia and Mandelbrot sets.

BUILD
-----

To build the julia and mandel binaries, either use the Imakefile or the 
sample makefile - Makefile.std. To build with the Imakefile, first type
"xmkmf" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system 
doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the julia binary will be
built. To create the mandel binary, type "ln julia mandel" as it is just
a link. 

The manual pages can be formatted by typing "nroff -man julia.man > julia.doc" 
and "nroff -man mandel.man > mandel.doc".

INSTALL
-------

To install julia, copy the julia binary to the desired location (the sample
makefiles put it in /usr/local/bin)
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/man/cat.LOCAL for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.
