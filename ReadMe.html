<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Julia and mandel are X11 clients.
Julia can be used to display the popular Julia sets. These sets are
calculated by iterating the map z -> z^2 + c where z and c are
Complex numbers, c a specified parameter and z the initial condition.
<P>
Mandel calculates and displays the Mandelbrot set. This is done by
iterating the same map, z -> z^2 + c, but here the initial condition
is held fixed at the origin and c is varied over a specified subset
of the Complex plane.
<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the julia and mandel binaries, either use the Imakefile or the 
sample makefile - Makefile.std. To build with the Imakefile, first type
"xmkmf" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system 
doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the julia binary will be
built. To create the mandel binary, type "ln julia mandel" as it is just
a link. 
<P>
The manual pages can be formatted by typing "nroff -man julia.man > julia.doc" 
and "nroff -man mandel.man > mandel.doc".

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install julia, copy the julia binary to the desired location (the sample
makefiles put it in /usr/local/bin)
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/man/cat.LOCAL for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.

<DT><B>Productivity</B>
<DD>These programs and others like them are probably responsible for more
CPU cycles than any other single application.

<DT><B>Safety</B>
<DD>I have used these for years without harm.

<DT><B>Work Planned</B>
<DD>None

<DT><B>Documentation</B>
<DD>manual pages.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>Execute any or all of the shell scripts provided in /usr/local/mathrec/julia
and /usr/local/mathrec/mandel.

<DT><B>Feedback</B>
